## Transfer learning image classifier using TensorFlow.js


* This is a custom image classifier that you can train on the fly in the browser 
using TensorFlow.js.

* This uses transfer learning to make create a highly accurate model with minimal
training data. 

* This uses a pre-trained model for image classification called **MobileNet**. 

* You will train a model on top of this one to customize the image classes it 
recognizes.
